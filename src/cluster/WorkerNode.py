        '''Creates a worker node to be simulated.
        The first argument (simulation_time) is the common simulation time.
        The second argument (hostname)       is the name of the worker node.
        The third argument (threads)         is the number of threads the machine has - usually this is equal to or double the number of cores (default is double)
        The fourth argument (memory)         is the about of RAM that is available on the core
        The fifth argument (idlepow)         is the average instantaneous power dissipated by an idle node in W.
        The sixth argument (freq_dep_specs)  is the variable that contains all the frequency-dependednt specifications that are be measured. Starting with the maximum 
                                                as the first element which will be the default. Here it is condensed to a dictionary of the frequencies (keys) in GHz
